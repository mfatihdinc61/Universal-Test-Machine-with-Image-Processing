## 📌 Project Description

The aim of the project was to develop an **affordable universal testing system** that performs:

- **Tensile testing**
- **Hardness testing**
- **Bending testing**

Unlike traditional machines, our system uses **image processing techniques** to extract mechanical behavior and measurements, eliminating the need for **expensive measurement equipment** such as extensometers, strain gauges, or force sensors.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Low-cost testing system** using vision-based measurement
- ✅ All algorithms implemented in **MATLAB**
- ✅ Tests conducted on custom-built mechanical rig with camera-based feedback
- ✅ Modular code and adaptable to different material testing scenarios

## 📽️ Demo Videos

Related test videos demonstrating the full system in action are available in the [`videos`](./videos) directory of this repository.

## 👥 Team

This project was developed by a team of six final-year Mechanical Engineering students from METU as part of their graduation requirement, Image processing part of the project was designed by the owner of this Repo
